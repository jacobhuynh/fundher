In December 2007, SLF Founder and President, Doris Buffett announced her intention to endow WISP as its own entity. On July 1, 2008 WISP, Inc. emerged as a stand-alone organization with a mission to enhance efforts toward economic justice by offering a means to help survivors of intimate partner abuse access higher education. WISP is available nationally to women who have left an abusive intimate partner relationship and who are pursuing an education with the goal of providing economic independence for themselves and their children.",
